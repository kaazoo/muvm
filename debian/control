Description: muvm
 muvm allows you to run arbitrary programs from your system in a microVM. It's comprised of three small programs:
 muvm: links against libkrun to create the microVM.
 muvm-guest: acts as an entrypoint inside the microVM to set up the environment for running your program.
 muvm-server: a server listening for requests to run additional programs. This allows you to run multiple graphical applications inside the same microVM.
